-- | Description : Low-level ZeroMQ communication wrapper.
--
-- The "ZeroMQ" module abstracts away the low-level 0MQ based interface with IPython,
-- replacing it instead with a Haskell Channel based interface. The `serveProfile` function
-- takes a IPython profile specification and returns the channel interface to use.
